# Tableau-Project
Tableau is used to visualize and analyze envta across regions and industries through interactive dashboardsironmental performance da for sustainability-driven decision-making.

## Environmental Impact Dashboard (Tableau Project)

## Overview
This project visualizes environmental performance data to support sustainability monitoring and eco-conscious decision-making. It provides key insights into carbon emissions, energy usage, recycling rates, water consumption, and compliance levels using an interactive Tableau dashboard.

## Tools Used
- Tableau Desktop
- Excel (for data source)
- Tableau Prep (for data cleaning)
- Calculated Fields & Parameters (for KPIs and interactivity)

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Collection:** Imported environmental dataset from Excel into Tableau.
2. **Data Cleaning:** Removed null values, standardized formats, and corrected category labels using Tableau Prep.
3. **Data Modeling:** Linked tables for region, industry, and environmental metrics.
4. **Calculated Fields:** Created KPIs such as Total Carbon Emissions, Average Recycling Rate, and Total Energy Usage.
5. **Dashboard Design:** Built interactive visuals with filters for Year, Industry, Region, and Compliance Level.

## Key Insights
- **Total Carbon Emissions:** 16.2M kg across all regions.
- **Average Recycling Rate:** 72.02% across industries.
- **Total Energy Usage:** 37.5M kWh, with peak usage in 2022.
- **Total Water Consumption:** 49.9M liters.
- **Asia and North America** recorded the highest carbon emissions (2.4M kg each).
- Construction and Automotive industries show the highest recycling rates.
- Compliance levels are evenly distributed across High, Medium, and Low categories.
- Scatter analysis indicates an inverse relationship between carbon emissions and recycling rates.
